                <p>Uber was founded in 2009 by Garrett Camp (also the founder of StumbleUpon), and Travis Kalanick.<br/><br/>

The company made its foray into food delivery in August, 2014 with the <br/><br/>
launch of the UberFRESH service in Santa Monica, California, South Africa and other countries.<br/> <br/>
In 2015, the platform was renamed to UberEATS, and the ordering software was released as its own application, separate from their UberRIDES app.
<br/><br/> At the same time, they expanded the platform to include Barcelona, Chicago, and New York City.
<br/><br/> UberEATS continued to expand throughout the second half of 2015.

How it works
Uber Eats teams up with restaurants in different cities to offer a range of cuisines. <br/><br/>
Uber Eats locations provide breakfast, lunch, brunch, and/or dinner menus. Some are open 24 hours every day.<br/><br/>

The Uber Eats smartphone/tablet application works on iPhone and Android-based devices. Ordering may also be done on a PC at the company website.
<br/><br/>
Users can read the menu, order, and pay using their deviceâ€”optionally including a gratuity for the delivery person.<br/><br/>
The app detects the user's location and displays restaurants open at the time separately from those that are closed.<br/><br/>
Payment is charged to a credit/debit card on file with Uber.<br/><br/>
Meals are delivered by couriers using cars, bikes, or on foot.<br/><br/>
Upon ordering, the customer is notified of the total price combining delivery fee and meal price.<br/><br/>
Customers can track the delivery status after the order is placed.<br/><br/>

The platform occasionally features food from local celebrity chefs wishing to<br/><br/>
increase their public visibility, including some who do not have physical restaurants.
